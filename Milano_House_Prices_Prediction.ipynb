    "## 1. Introduction to the project and sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the application of linear regression to predict house prices in the Italian city of Milan based on various features commonly used in real estate analysis. The Linear Regression Model comprises essential property attributes such as the number of rooms, square meters, bathrooms, price, and neighborhood, offering a comprehensive view of the factors influencing property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the robustness and accuracy of the model, extensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps were carried out. These steps include inspecting and refining key columns, adding a derived feature called \"price per square meter,\" and removing outliers using both business logic and statistical methods. Additionally, categorical data like \"neighborhood\" was transformed into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully cleaning all the required variables, the second part of the project focuses on building the linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model is tested with a function that allows users to input self-defined values (e.g., \"neighborhood\" and \"number of rooms\") and receive the predicted price as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a structured approach to handling messy datasets and highlights how data science can support the real estate industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The dataset used in this project was extracted by Tommaso Ramella through web scraping from a popular Italian real estate website. His dataset provides valuable insights into the housing market in Milan and has been shared on Kaggle for use by other data enthusiasts. The dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommasoramella/milano-housing-price\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This project is based on the techniques and code from the YouTube tutorial:\n",
    "\"Machine Learning & Data Science Project\" by \"Codebasics\" (https://www.youtube.com/@codebasics)\n",
    "I created a case study and adapted the code using a different dataset."

    "\n",
    "A real estate agency operating in Milan wants to optimize its pricing strategies. They aim to provide accurate price estimates to their clients (both sellers and buyers) and remain competitive in the market. They hired me as a data scientist to build a model that predicts house prices based on property features. This model will also help their agents provide data-driven recommendations to clients during negotiations."

    "This project began with a typical data science scenario in the real estate industry: a real estate agency aiming to implement a housing price prediction model to gain a competitive edge in its day-to-day operations.\n",

    "Through this project, we highlighted the crucial importance of the data cleaning process. Without proper data cleaning, the model would produce inaccurate results. Specifically, techniques like feature engineering and outlier removal are essential steps in ensuring clean data, alongside standard practices such as dropping irrelevant columns and dealing with NaN values.\n",

    "The linear regression model proved to be an effective prediction tool for this case study, as the relationship between housing prices and their features is often linear. This was further confirmed by the high R² score achieved during model evaluation."
